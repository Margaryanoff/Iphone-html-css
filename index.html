                        What's the difference between the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch OLED display and the iPhone XS Max has a 6.5-inch OLED display, meaning the iPhone Xs Max is larger; however, other than that, there is no difference between the two new phones on the inside.

                </div>

                        The Insides
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        The iPhone Xs and iPhone XS Max use the new A12 Bionic chip. Both phones have a 6-core CPU and a 4-core GPU, both of which are faster and more powerful than iPhone X from last year.
                    </p>

                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max both come with a dual camera system on the back that consists of an f1.8 12MP wide-angle lens and an f2.4 12MP telephoto lens.

                    <p>
                        The video capabilities are the same as the last year's iPhone X, meaning you can expect the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max to have the following video specs:

                        <li>720p HD video recording at 30 fps</li>
